# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Claude Code Rewind Tool is a revolutionary terminal-based system that provides time-travel debugging capabilities for Claude Code actions. It automatically captures project state snapshots before every Claude Code action and enables granular rollback functionality with visual diff viewing. This tool eliminates the fear of AI-induced code changes by providing instant, reliable rollback capabilities, making developers feel confident when using Claude Code for complex modifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Claude Code, I want automatic state capture before every Claude action, so that I can always revert unwanted changes without losing work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude Code executes any tool action THEN the system SHALL capture a complete project snapshot before the action
2. WHEN capturing snapshots THEN the system SHALL use incremental storage to minimize disk usage
3. WHEN capturing snapshots THEN the system SHALL complete within 500ms for projects under 1GB
4. WHEN capturing snapshots THEN the system SHALL store metadata including timestamp, action type, files affected, and prompt context
5. IF a snapshot fails to capture THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without blocking Claude Code execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want granular rollback capabilities, so that I can selectively revert specific changes while preserving other work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a rollback THEN the system SHALL allow me to roll back to any specific Claude action point
2. WHEN performing rollback THEN the system SHALL support selective file rollback where I can choose which files to revert
3. WHEN performing rollback THEN the system SHALL implement "smart rollback" that preserves manual changes made after Claude actions
4. WHEN I initiate rollback THEN the system SHALL show a preview of changes before execution
5. IF conflicts exist during rollback THEN the system SHALL present resolution options to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual diff capabilities, so that I can understand exactly what Claude changed in each action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a snapshot THEN the system SHALL show exactly what Claude changed in that action
2. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side diff viewer in terminal
3. WHEN showing code changes THEN the system SHALL include syntax highlighting for supported languages
4. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL provide line-by-line annotation showing Claude's modifications
5. WHEN viewing large diffs THEN the system SHALL support scrolling and navigation within the terminal interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an interactive timeline interface, so that I can easily navigate through Claude's actions and find specific changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the timeline THEN the system SHALL provide terminal-based timeline navigation
2. WHEN viewing the timeline THEN the system SHALL categorize actions by type (file edits, command runs, git operations)
3. WHEN using the timeline THEN the system SHALL support search and filter functionality for snapshots
4. WHEN managing snapshots THEN the system SHALL allow me to bookmark important snapshots
5. WHEN navigating the timeline THEN the system SHALL provide keyboard shortcuts for efficient operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless Claude Code integration, so that the tool works transparently without affecting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude Code runs THEN the system SHALL hook into Claude Code's tool execution lifecycle automatically
2. WHEN the tool operates THEN the system SHALL not slow down Claude Code execution by more than 100ms per action
3. WHEN installed THEN the system SHALL work cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. WHEN operating in a git repository THEN the system SHALL respect .gitignore rules and integrate with git history
5. IF the tool encounters errors THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without breaking Claude Code functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive CLI commands, so that I can manage snapshots and rollbacks efficiently from the terminal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize the tool THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind init` command to set up the project
2. WHEN I check status THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind status` command showing current snapshots
3. WHEN I want to browse history THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind timeline` for interactive timeline view
4. WHEN I need to rollback THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind rollback <snapshot-id>` command
5. WHEN I want to see changes THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind diff <snapshot-id>` command
6. WHEN I want to preview changes THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind preview <snapshot-id>` command
7. WHEN managing storage THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind cleanup` command to remove old snapshots
8. WHEN sharing changes THEN the system SHALL provide `claude-rewind export <snapshot-id>` command to export as patch

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable data safety and performance, so that I can trust the tool with my important projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing snapshots THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity through checksums and validation
2. WHEN operating THEN the system SHALL prioritize performance with snapshot operations completing under 1 second
3. WHEN managing storage THEN the system SHALL not consume more than 10% of available disk space by default
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL include safeguards against accidental data loss
5. IF corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms and clear error reporting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer new to the tool, I want intuitive UX and clear documentation, so that I can start using it confidently without extensive learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the terminal interface THEN the system SHALL provide clean, intuitive design with rich colors and syntax highlighting
2. WHEN performing long operations THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN using the tool THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and usage examples
